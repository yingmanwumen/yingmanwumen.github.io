Data Science 一无所知、大学的统计考了60分刚刚好的 Coder，我需要以一种适合自己的方式去接触这门对我而言全新的学科。\n线性回归模型似乎是 Hello World 级别的课题，就从这里开始吧。\n我需要在正式开始之前，明确我想学到的知识是什么。作为小镇做题家，解题是我最擅长的事情了。下面这些问题是我认为至关重要的：\n\nLinear Regression 是什么、有什么用？\nLinear Regression的 优势、劣势 分别是什么？\nLinear Regression 的 使用场景 是什么？什么时候应该使用 Linear Regression、什么时候不应该使用 Linear Regression？\n有哪些衍生自 Linear Regression 的 model？\n使用 Linear Regression 的过程中、需要注意哪些问题？\n有什么现成的 library、framework、或者 resolver 可以用于使用 Linear Regression 来解决问题？\n如果我想深入学习 Linear Regression，有哪些经典的书籍、paper 可以作为 reference？\n\n\n在 LLM 发明前，我需要阅读大量的书籍、提取并总结大量信息，运气好的话才有可能从中找到一部分答案 —— 更重要的是，我需要花费大量的时间才能解决我的问题。而现在有了 LLM，一切就变得简单了起来，只要有一套高效的、适合自己的学习体系，配合 LLM 广阔的知识，任何人都能在极短的时间内入门某个课题。\n\nLinear Regression 的定义及应用场景\nLinear\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\sum_j\\beta_j\\Phi_j(x_j) + \\varepsilon\n$$\n线性模型中线性的意思是：只要参数是线性的，那么这个模型就是线性的。\n上述公式中，即使 $\\Phi(x)$ 是 $x^2$ 或者 $e^x$，都不影响这个模型是一个线性模型 —— 因为它的参数是线性的。\n以下是非线性模型的例子：\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n&amp;Y = \\beta_1 x^{\\beta2} \\\\\n&amp;Y = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 e^{\\beta_3x} \\\\\n&amp;Y = x_1 x_2\n\\end{split}\n$$\n一种直观的判断方法是观察 $x$ 是否只被一个 $\\beta$ 影响。\nRegression\n回归分析是一种研究数据的方法，目的是分析多个变量之间的相关性，以此来预测目标变量的值。\n\n“回归”一词最早由法兰西斯·高尔顿（Francis Galton）所使用。他曾对亲子间的身高做研究，发现父母的身高虽然会遗传给子女，但子女的身高却有逐渐“回归到中等（即人的平均值）”的现象。不过现在的回归已经和当初的意义不尽相同。\n\n$$\nE(X|Y) = f(X, \\beta)\n$$\n其中\n\n$X$ 为自变量\n$Y$ 为因变量\n$\\beta$ 为回归系数\n$f$ 为回归函数\n$E$ 为期望\n\n应用场景\n什么情况下能使用 Linear Regression？\n\n古典假设\n\n样本是在总体中 随机抽取 的\n因变量 $Y$ 在实直线上连续\n残差项独立随机且服从正态分布\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-sg/%E8%BF%B4%E6%AD%B8%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90\nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-sg/%E7%B7%9A%E6%80%A7%E5%9B%9E%E6%AD%B8\nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-sg/%E6%AD%A3%E6%80%81%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83\nhttps://zh.d2l.ai/chapter_linear-networks/linear-regression.html\nhttps://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/74673610\nhttps://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/127972563\n\n","id":"https://yingmanwumen.github.io/2025-10-19-linear-regression/","title":"(Draft)
